subtitle: Utilizing AI to Curate, Analyze, and Amplify Global Black Voices
project_title: "The African Diaspora Media Hub"

problem: |
  Despite the vast and diverse media content generated across the African Diaspora, there is a lack of centralized platforms that effectively curate, analyze, and personalize this content for educational, cultural, and social engagement. Existing media hubs often overlook nuanced representations of Black identities and fail to support multilingual accessibility across African and diaspora languages. This fragmentation limits the visibility of underrepresented voices, hinders academic research, and reduces user engagement. There is a need for an intelligent, inclusive platform that leverages AI and machine learning to organize, interpret, and amplify content related to the African Diaspora in a meaningful and accessible way.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Aggregate news, videos, literature, and research papers centered on the African Diaspora using manual sourcing and structured metadata tagging.
  - Apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4 to generate relevant, theme-aligned summaries and searchable outputs.
  - Engineer custom prompts to fine-tune GPT responses, enabling context-aware AI interactions tied to cultural and historical significance.
  - Design and deploy a full-stack web platform using Node.js, MongoDB, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, delivering an intuitive, AI-enhanced user experience.

  Technologies used include GPT-4 APIs, prompt engineering frameworks, and full-stack development tools to create a scalable, culturally aware platform.

outcome: |
  The result is an interactive media hub that allows users to explore AI-generated insights into curated content across the African Diaspora. It supports contextual search, thematic exploration, and user-friendly access to cultural narratives, while offering hands-on experience in prompt engineering, AI retrieval workflows, and full-stack development.
