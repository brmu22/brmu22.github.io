subtitle: Harnessing AI to Curate, Analyze, and Amplify Global Black Voices
project_title: "The African Diaspora Media Hub"

problem: |
  Despite the vast and diverse media content generated across the African Diaspora, there is a lack of centralized platforms that effectively curate, analyze, and personalize this content for educational, cultural, and social engagement. Existing media hubs often overlook nuanced representations of Black identities and fail to support multilingual accessibility across African and diaspora languages. This fragmentation limits the visibility of underrepresented voices, hinders academic research, and reduces user engagement. There is a need for an intelligent, inclusive platform that leverages AI and machine learning to organize, interpret, and amplify content related to the African Diaspora in a meaningful and accessible way.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

  - Collect EEG data during imagined movements using a non-invasive BCI headset
  - Train machine learning models to decode intent from neural patterns
  - Integrate real-time signal classification with a robotic arm interface
  - Evaluate system performance in simulated daily activities (e.g., object grasping, pointing)

  Open-source tools such as OpenBCI, Python (MNE, Scikit-learn), and ROS (Robot Operating System) will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, the project will result in a working prototype of a BCI-controlled robotic arm and a poster presentation outlining the system architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation metrics. Insights from the user study will inform future directions in adaptive assistive technology.
