what_i_learned: |
  We kicked off the morning with a presentation for the Dean and Associate Dean of Global Journalism at Morgan State to showcase our website. At this point in the program, I’ve presented so many times that I felt much more confident going into it. Thankfully, we were given a heads-up for this one, so the team knew exactly what we wanted to highlight. Their response was really encouraging, they had great feedback and even mentioned the possibility of using the site as a resource for one of the communication courses at Morgan State after we deploy. That kind of validation felt great and reminded us of the real-world impact our work can have.

  None today, just continuing to fine-tune the details.

reflection: |
  It’s crazy how much more natural presenting has started to feel. Earlier in the program, I would’ve been so nervous about a meeting like this, but now it feels like second nature. After the presentation, we filmed our weekly team video to talk through accomplishments and challenges from the week. I spent the rest of the day making small UI tweaks across the site, adjusting layouts, cleaning up visuals, and making sure everything looks cohesive. It’s impressive to see how far the project has come and how close we are to the finish line.
