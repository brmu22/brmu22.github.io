what_i_learned: |
  We jumped right back into Python practice today. One of the exercises involved users entering numbers, and the program would output the minimum, maximum, average, and categorize the numbers into even and odd. It helped reinforce concepts around file handling and conditionals. After lunch, we had a presentation on generative AI, which covered topics I was already familiar with, but it was helpful to revisit the basics. 

blockers: |
  The coding exercises were generally smooth, even though I ran into a few minor syntax errors that slowed me down. Nothing major, but enough to remind me to double-check formatting.

reflection: |
  The gen AI session was a nice refresher, and I appreciated the mix of activities throughout the day (Kahoot and Bot or Not). Even though the syntax issues were a bit annoying, it’s all part of learning. The Bot or Not game was a fun way to test our eyes against AI-generated content.
