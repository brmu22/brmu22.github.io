what_i_learned: |
  Today was the most interesting thus far. Each of us was tasked with researching 4 of our assigned countries to begin populating a dataset for our AI model. It was super time-consuming, however, definitely fun since we are (officially) starting to do something tangible for the website.

  After lunch, I met back up with my project group. We predominantly continued to work on research for our dataset until the end of the day. I'm excited for tomorrow because each of us is tasked with creating a demo front page for our site, and whoever's looks the best will be chosen!

  An easy day. 💃🏽

reflection: |
  I had fun researching today. My countries were Brazil, Angola, Colombia, and Benin and it was interesting learning about the diaspora.
