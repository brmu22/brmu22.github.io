what_i_learned: |
  Today felt like a Friday-eve break. We toured Morgan State's campus for the first half of the day. It was nice to see everyone again and inquire about what they've been working on, learn about their interests, and hear about any challenges they're facing so far.

  After lunch, I met back up with my project group. We predominantly worked on our Week 1 challenges and accomplishments PowerPoint and presentation video. We ended our day by finishing up an HTML/CSS demo video.

  An easy day. 💃🏽

reflection: |
  There's not much reflection for today. Although I do think our team in this first week has created a solid foundation of communication, collaboration, and teamwork. I believe in our ability to successfully be able to deliver this project since we focused on the necessary stepping stones this week. I'm very excited to see the progress of my teammates that has no coding experience. Everyone had hiccups this week, but it seems like they are starting to grasp some of the material.
