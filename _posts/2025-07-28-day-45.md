what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on enhancing the Visual Arts page, making it more interactive and informative. It’s one thing to display images, it’s another to give them meaningful context and user flow. I learned how small design tweaks, hover interactions, and brief captions can really shift how someone experiences a cultural archive. This was less about new tech and more about communicating the weight and creativity of Black visual storytelling. I also found that curating what to highlight is just as much an act of design as writing code.

blockers: |
 I had to spend extra time formatting captions and making sure the layout stayed responsive.

reflection: |
  Working on the culture section has been interesting in the best way. The Visual Arts page, in particular, feels like a celebration of creativity that’s often erased or underrepresented. It’s not just a gallery, it’s a statement about identity, resistance, and legacy. I’m proud of how we’re honoring that visually and digitally. This reminds me why design with purpose matters so much.
