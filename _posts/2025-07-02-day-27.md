what_i_learned: |
  Today was about perfecting the presentation for tomorrow. We spent a lot of time reviewing slides, practicing, and making sure the flow made sense. At first, we were definitely feeling the pressure, but after getting feedback from our mentors, the team felt a lot more at ease. We also met with Jason from the Morgan State University library, who gave us some really helpful resources and databases to support our research for the site. He also shared some best practices that we’ll definitely carry with us into the final weeks of the project.

  All is well!
  
reflection: |
  The day started off kind of rocky, but it definitely picked up once we got into a groove. Seeing how far we’ve come and now being able to present it confidently, feels good. Jason’s advice also gave us an extra boost, and I’m glad we’re building something grounded in both creativity and credible research. The upcoming long weekend is right on time, I’m definitely feeling exhausted. But at the same time, I’m proud of what we’ve pulled together so far.
