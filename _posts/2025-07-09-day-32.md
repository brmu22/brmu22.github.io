  Today, we decided to start developing the Learning tab for the site, which will serve as a space for users to engage with learning resources. I’m working on building a glossary feature that will include flashcards, a quiz mode, and other interactive tools to make definitions more accessible to users of all ages and knowledge levels. It’s important that even people unfamiliar with certain terms or historical references can understand and feel included as they explore. We also started brainstorming ways to integrate AI into this section, maybe using it to give users custom definitions or even short explanations in plain language.

  All is well!

   While working on this, I came across Latimer AI, which is a model designed specifically to provide insights and summaries rooted in Black culture and history. Using something like Latimer for Voices of the Diaspora feels like a perfect fit because it aligns with our mission of amplifying diasporic voices. It could help generate definitions, suggest related terms, or even provide cultural context in a way that feels authentic. I’m excited about the possibilities, but also aware there’s more research needed to see how we’d integrate it. For now, I’m focusing on getting the foundation of the glossary built so we can layer in the AI enhancements later.
