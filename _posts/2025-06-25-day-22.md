what_i_learned: |
  We got news that our presentation was pushed to next week, which definitely helped take the pressure off the team. With the extra time, I was able to fully complete the pre-slavery interactive map and finally get the markers to display and behave the way they should. We also started presentation prep, so we’re starting to map out how we’ll showcase our progress. Even though I’m still a bit tired, I’m glad we’re hitting key milestones and slowly locking down our MVPs. It’s helping me see how everything is starting to come together.

  An alright day. 💃🏽
  
reflection: |
  I definitely feel less stressed now that the deadline has moved, but I’m still pacing myself. There’s a lot left to do, and I want to make the most of the extra time. Getting the map to work was a win, especially since it’s one of the more complex interactive features. Tonight, I plan to work on integrating our AI model to the article summarization feature, and hopefully connect that with the sidebar panel on the maps for more context. It’s still a bit stressful, but I’m motivated to push through and make sure the final product feels complete.
