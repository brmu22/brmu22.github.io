what_i_learned: |
  Today was about integrating our custom dataset into the AI. Itâ€™s a bit overwhelming, but seeing it all come together is nice. Most of the core features are now complete, at least for Phase 1 and what we plan to present for the final presentation. We also made more progress in regard to our elevator pitch. We tried to figure out how to convey the purpose of the project clearly and confidently. 

blockers: |
  Integration work is dense and slightly stressful, especially with everything needing to wrap up so soon.

reflection: |
  It feels like weâ€™re entering the final bit. The product is starting to feel whole. Weâ€™re also preparing to meet someone our faculty mentor arranged for us to demo the site. Potentially to someone who is interested in helping us raise funding ðŸ‘€. Itâ€™s exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time. I just hope we continue to hold it all together through the finish line.
