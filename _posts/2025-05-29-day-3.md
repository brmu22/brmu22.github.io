  Today, we were introduced to computer vision concepts through a demo, which reminded me of a facial emotion detection project I built a few years ago. It was interesting to see how CV has advanced since then. We took a break by participating in a virtual escape room puzzle, I personally didn't enjoy that aspect of the day. However, in the afternoon, we focused on intermediate Python practice. We worked with dictionaries and sets by writing programs such as a word frequency counter that uses a dictionary to track how often each word appears in a sentence. We also got an introduction and practiced file manipulation in Python, which helped wrap up the day’s lesson.

  The virtual escape room before lunch didn’t really click with me. I didn’t enjoy the format, but at least my team and I managed to figure out the puzzle.

reflection: |
  Revisiting computer vision reminded me how much I enjoy learning and tinkering with applied ML. The Python exercises helped to remind me of key concepts like manipulating dictionaries, sets, and basic file handling. Even though the escape room wasn’t my cup of tea, it was nice seeing how my team and I worked together.
