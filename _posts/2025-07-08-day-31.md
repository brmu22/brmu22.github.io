what_i_learned: |
  We spent part of the day discussing researcher best practices since we’ll need to write a research paper by the end of the program. It was a good reminder to think critically about source credibility and how to document our process. On the technical side, I started researching how to create AI-generated summaries for videos and integrate them into the site with minimal overhead. The goal is to make it scalable. I also realized it may be time to start laying out the backend, which could make future features and data handling much smoother.

  All is well!
  
reflection: |
  Today was more of a planning and research day. I feel like it gave me the mental space to think through some of the harder problems ahead. Figuring out how to get the AI to summarize video content is a big step, but breaking it down into smaller pieces makes it feel doable. Starting on the backend soon is probably the smartest move, so we’re not scrambling later. Overall, it was a slower day, but an important one for setting up the next phase.
