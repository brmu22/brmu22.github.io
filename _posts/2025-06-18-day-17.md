what_i_learned: |
   We met with a high school teacher today, who’s officially joining our group. He teaches AP History and just wrapped up African American History, so I’m excited to see how he’ll contribute. Having someone with that kind of historical background could really help the educational side of our project. We also did a few icebreakers during our enrichment block, which was a fun break from the usual tech-heavy work. After lunch, we sat down as a group and mapped out what’s next for the site so we’re all on the same page moving forward. It’s been helpful to check in like this before we go any deeper into building.

blockers: |
   Small bugs with page redirects and PNGs still not displaying in certain sections.

reflection: |
  I’m really looking forward to collaborating with the teacher. Having someone outside of our core group can provide new insight and help us shape the narrative side of the work. Today was slower in terms of coding progress, but the conversations we had about next steps were necessary. I’m still battling some lingering frontend bugs, and it’s frustrating when things like PNGs and page routing refuse to behave. But I’m learning to take it piece by piece instead of stressing over it all at once. We’ve got a good foundation, and I’m just trying to stay focused and not let the small stuff throw me off.
