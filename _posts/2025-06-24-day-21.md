what_i_learned: |
  I continued working on the site today, focusing mainly on making the interactive maps more engaging and refining how the AI integration delivers summaries and information. It’s been a challenge trying to balance feature development with presentation prep, especially within such a short timeframe. As the one leading the technical side of things, it’s definitely been a bit overwhelming trying to make sure everything is functional in time. I’ve had to work outside of our scheduled hours just to catch up on what we lost earlier in the project. The AI features are coming along, but there’s still a lot to lock in before Friday.

blockers: |
  Time constraints and pressure from presentation requirements, technical tasks, and prep.

reflection: |
  Honestly, I’m feeling a little drained. It’s crunch time, and I’m carrying a lot of the technical weight, which makes it hard to stay optimistic when things aren’t moving as fast as I’d like. The presentation being 15 minutes long, plus not knowing the order, is adding to my stress. I just want to make sure everything works and represents the team well. That said, I’m still showing up and doing the work. My main priority now is to ensure the MVP features, especially the AI integration, are strong enough to demo. I’m pushing through and hoping the effort pays off by the end of the week.
