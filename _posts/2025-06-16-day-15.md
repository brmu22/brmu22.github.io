what_i_learned: |
   Today, we officially started building out the frontend! I created the folder structure and started designing the layout, making decisions around formatting and what features to keep or toss. I ran into a few issues, like getting flag PNGs to display properly, but overall, things are coming together. It’s been helpful to work side-by-side with one teammate while the others focus on imagery and gathering site resources. Even though it’s early in the build phase, we’re already laying down a solid structure for what’s to come.

blockers: |
  Trouble displaying some PNGs (flags), but working through it.

reflection: |
  It feels good to finally see things take shape visually after spending so much time prepping in the background. Figuring out the folder structure and styling gave me a better sense of what the site can be and how we can evolve it. Collaborating with one of my teammates helped smooth out some ideas and made problem-solving a little easier. There are definitely small bugs and adjustments to work through, but we’ve got something real to build from now. I’m excited to keep tweaking and polishing it as we continue to progress.
