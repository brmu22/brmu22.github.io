what_i_learned: |
  Today involved a lot more research. We had to verify a ton of resources for our dataset. We're also missing two team members today, so taking on the bit of extra work was a bit overwhelming for me. I realized how important it is to critically evaluate sources, especially when building something that others will rely on. I’m also learning how to better manage my time and energy when the workload unexpectedly increases.

  After lunch, we met with Dr. Kopano to discuss goals to be completed by the end of the week, as well as a relative schedule for things to complete next week.

  Nothing to dwell on. 🤷🏽‍♀️

reflection: |
  I was reminded that there is a mid-summer symposium at the end of the month. This has me a bit worried about whether we'll have something tangible to showcase. I'm also starting to feel a bit fatigued with all the research, as we’ve been digging through sources for days now, and I’m eager to start coding and building something real. It’s been a little overwhelming covering for missing team members, but I’m doing my best to keep things moving forward. I’m hoping that next week brings more structure and hands-on work so the project starts to feel more concrete.
