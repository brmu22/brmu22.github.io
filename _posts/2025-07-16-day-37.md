what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on polishing up the site’s functionality and refining the user experience. I worked on making the Culture and Arts section feel more dynamic by adding interactive elements and updating content to better reflect diverse voices from across the diaspora. I also spent some time testing the AI-generated content across different features, making sure biographies, definitions, and summaries felt consistent and culturally appropriate. This involved tweaking the prompts and filtering results for accuracy. On top of that, I started mapping out how we might integrate a “key takeaways” feature for each page so users leave with a clear understanding of what they learned.

blockers: |
  Minor bugs with image alignment and inconsistent AI responses that needed additional prompt engineering.

reflection: |
  It’s satisfying to see the site shaping up into something that’s not just functional but also engaging and educational. I’m realizing how important these final tweaks are in creating a solid product that feels seamless for users. Even though small bugs and AI quirks slow things down at times, I feel more confident in my ability to troubleshoot and iterate quickly. With about two weeks left, the pressure is definitely on, but I’m proud of how far the team and I have come.
