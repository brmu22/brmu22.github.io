what_i_learned: |
  Most of today was focused on prepping for our presentation. We received a lot of feedback from our faculty mentor, high school teacher, and grad mentor. The perspectives were helpful, but also a little overwhelming. Some thought the slides were too wordy, others wanted more visuals. It’s hard to balance all the input and still keep everything intact, but I know it’s coming from a good place. Outside of that, I worked on editing and finalizing our recorded demo to include in the presentation.

  Pressure from last-minute presentation changes and navigating conflicting feedback.
  
reflection: |
  The team is definitely feeling the pressure, and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little frustrating. Everyone wants us to succeed, but the amount of critique this close to the presentation feels like a lot. I know it’s pushing us to put out something stronger, even if it’s stressful in the moment. I’m trying to focus on the pieces I can control and trust that the rest will fall into place. We’ve come this far, and I believe we’ll be able to pull it off.
