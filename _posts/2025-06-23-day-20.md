what_i_learned: |
   I made some solid progress on the frontend today. I successfully implemented multilingual translations for the site, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and French, so it's feeling way more accessible and in tune with the diasporic communities we’re trying to reach. I also integrated OpenAI’s API to generate country summaries, which feels like a major win! Earlier, I ran into a problem where the site was defaulting to fallback summaries instead of the AI-generated ones, but I got it fixed after some troubleshooting. There's still a weird Google Translate banner I’m trying to remove, but overall, the UI is shaping up nicely.

blockers: |
   Minor UI issue: Google Translate banner that needs to be removed (because it's ugly)

reflection: |
  I’m feeling accomplished today, the multilingual support and OpenAI integration really made the site feel like it’s leveling up. Being able to generate country summaries and tailoring them to our audience makes a huge difference in how informative and dynamic the experience can be. I’m starting to think more about how we can let AI pull from our curated documents to provide even deeper, context-aware content. The interactive map may need a rework to meet our standards, but I’m trying not to get too caught up in that just yet. Right now, I’m focused on tightening up our MVPs so we’re ready to present something tangible by the end of the week.
