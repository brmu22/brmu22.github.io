what_i_learned: |
  I spent more time refining the culture section today, especially focusing on the little visual and textual details. Everything from color placement to spacing and section headings contributes to the overall feel. I learned that you can’t underestimate how much design impacts interpretation. Even though it’s not new functionality, it helps how users emotionally receive the content. Every edit has weight, even the small ones.

blockers: |
  The biggest struggle today was wanting to perfect everything with so little time left. 

reflection: |
  Even though it may seem like I’m just tweaking a web page, it’s actually a really important part of the process. These final touches will help shape how first-time users understand our mission and connect with the project. I want our site to feel like more than just a tech demo, it should be a space people want to come back to. It feels good to step back and realize how much we’ve already done, even as I’m obsessing over fonts and such. At this point, it’s about making sure everything lands with intention.
