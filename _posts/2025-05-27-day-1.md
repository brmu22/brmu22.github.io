what_i_learned: |
  Today was moreso a refresher course for me. I'm already pretty familiar with Git and GitHub, so most of the material felt like revisiting old habits such as setting up repositories, making commits, and pushing to branches. There was also a Python placement test that was straightforward as well, but it gave me a good sense of where I stand and which areas I might want to brush up on as the course progresses.

blockers: |
  None at this time.

reflection: |
  Today served as a solid introduction and reset. Although the Git and GitHub content was mainly review for me, it was helpful to reinforce best practices and clean up any habits I may have picked up over time. The Python placement test was a good checkpoint, as it reminded me of concepts I’m comfortable with and highlighted areas I could revisit. Overall, it feels good to be easing back into a structured learning environment, and I’m looking forward to diving deeper into new material.
