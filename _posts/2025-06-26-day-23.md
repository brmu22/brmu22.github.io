what_i_learned: |
  I focused on the literature section of the site today and was able to integrate AI to summarize different types of written work, such as books, articles, research papers etc. It’s a nice addition that helps make the content more digestible for users, especially those who may not have time to read through everything. I also made a few small UI adjustments, like adding images to bring more visual aspects to the site. The AI is mostly working as expected, but there are still moments where the summaries don’t come out quite how I want. Still, it’s progress, and I’m learning how to adjust the inputs to get better results.

blockers: |
  Minor issues with AI response quality.

reflection: |
  Today was pretty chill coding-wise, which was nice after the past few hectic days. Even though the AI output still needs some refining, the fact that we have it working across multiple parts of the site feels like a major step. We’re getting closer to being fully prepped for the presentation next week. I’m proud of how much ground we’ve covered in a short amount of time. At this point, it’s just about polishing and making sure everything runs smoothly when it’s time to present.
