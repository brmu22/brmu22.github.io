what_i_learned: |
  Presentation day went really well! Our group ended up being first, which threw me off at first because I wasn’t mentally prepared to kick things off, but it ended up being a blessing in disguise. We got through it confidently and set the tone for the rest of the day. During lunch, we even had a few other teams and mentors compliment us on how useful and impactful our project seemed. I also enjoyed seeing the other presentations. My favorite was the team working on identifying skin cancer in darker-toned individuals, which feels like such an important and often overlooked area. Another standout was the group that built a physical sensor to detect clean vs. dirty water, which was impressive and very hands-on.

  Nerves at the start of the day, but nothing major, once we began presenting, it flowed naturally.

reflection: |
  I’m really proud of how our team handled today. Going first wasn’t easy, but we stayed calm, hit all our talking points, and showed off the site well. Hearing genuine interest from others about our project reminded me why we’re doing this and why it matters. Seeing the diversity of projects from the other teams was inspiring too. It’s cool to see how everyone’s using AI to solve problems. Now that the mid-program presentations are done, I’m feeling more motivated for the final.
