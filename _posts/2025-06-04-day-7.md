what_i_learned: |
  Today, we worked on something right up my alley: building websites! My project team members are virtually new to programming, and with our final product being a website, what better way to gain hands-on practice than building a demo site? I haven't line-by-line coded a site in a while, so it was fun to go through the tutorial as if it were my first time. I learned a few new small things, like I know what certain code is used for, but I learned syntax-wise the *why* it is used. 

  After lunch, we continued to work on the demo, and I was able to help one of my team members who was struggling with the material. We also, as a group, realized that some people need more support than others, so we discussed how to move forward so that everyone is on track. It just emphasizes how important communication will be for the success of the website.

  Smooth sailing today. üíÉüèΩ

reflection: |
  I'm glad that most of this week so far has been emphasizing the basics instead of throwing us immediately in the deep end. It's not only giving us a feel of where everyone stands, but for everyone that is brand new, it would be a cool project to take on and skills to build. It's also nice that everyone is collaborative and voices when they're struggling, it'll help us as we progress and dive deeper into the project, so that there's less room for confusion or missing a deadline because someone waited last minute to say that they are having an issue with their part. 

Overall, it was a solid Wednesday! ‚ú®
