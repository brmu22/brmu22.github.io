  We started the day with our usual Friday team video, reflecting on the week’s challenges and accomplishments. The real surprise came when our faculty mentor, who was attending a campus conference on Black and African diasporic voices, invited a group of university leaders, including deans and VPs, to view a live demo of our site. It caught us off guard, but honestly, it ended up being a highlight of the week. The feedback we received was positive and encouraging, especially from people in positions that could really help amplify our work. It reminded me that our project isn’t just technical, it has an impact as well.

reflection: |
  I didn’t expect to do a live demo today, especially in front of such high-level people, but it actually turned out to be a great experience. I was nervous at first since it was so last minute, but once we walked them through our vision and progress, it was clear they saw the value. It felt good to have our work acknowledged in that setting, especially after a week that’s been full of stress. Our mentor treated us to lunch afterward, which was great. This definitely is a solid way to wrap up the week and go into the final bit of prep feeling a bit more confident.
