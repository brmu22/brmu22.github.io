what_i_learned: |
  During our weekly enrichment block, we had a presenter talk about how to write and format research papers. Honestly, it was a little confusing, and I don’t think they explained things as clearly as they could have. Thankfully, they mentioned the writing center as an additional resource, which I think will be helpful when it’s time to write our paper. On the technical side, I made good progress on the glossary feature. I got it pulling terms from across the site and having the AI generate definitions, etymologies, pronunciations, etc. It’s starting to feel like a real learning tool for users.

  All is well!
  
reflection: |
   Today felt pretty chill compared to earlier in the week. Getting the glossary to populate from multiple parts of the site and connect with the AI feels like a solid achievement. I’m also excited about the possibility of setting up our AWS account soon so we can finally start on backend development and move toward a deployed site. I'm also looking into changing our model as suggested. It’s all coming together, and I’m trying to stay patient and focused as we get closer to the end of the program.
