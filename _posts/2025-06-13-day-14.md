what_i_learned: |
   Today, I continued populating one of the datasets we’ll use for the model, which is starting to feel more manageable now that I’ve collected enough credible sources. It’s been a lot of reading, but with the research mostly in place, I’m moving faster through the data. I also worked with my team on our Week 3 recap video, where we went over the highlights and hurdles we faced this week. That helped me reflect on how much we’ve actually gotten done. We also began drafting the HTML/CSS to get a feel for what next week’s build phase might look like.

  An easy day. 💃🏽

reflection: |
  Research wasn’t too bad today, thanks to the momentum I’ve built over the past few days. Still, I’m definitely feeling some mental fatigue from constantly combing through articles and making sure everything checks out. But having a solid foundation has made it easier to stay focused and productive. Collaborating on the recap video was a nice reset, it reminded me that this is a team effort, and we’re all building toward something real. Playing around with layout ideas also gave me something more visual and creative to end the week on.✨
