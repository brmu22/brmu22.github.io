what_i_learned: |
  Today, I focused on refining the glossary feature and integrating more interactive elements like a quiz mode and flashcards. It’s been nice to see how these small additions make the Learning tab feel more complete and engaging. I also spent some time testing the AI-generated definitions for accuracy and clarity, making sure they’re understandable for users of different ages and knowledge levels. The team and I started discussing how to connect the glossary and Culture and Arts sections, so users can explore terms and then see related cultural examples in context. Small UI enhancements, like improving readability and adding placeholder imagery, rounded out most of my work for the day.

  Still navigating how to make the AI summaries concise enough for flashcards without losing context.

reflection: |
  Things are really starting to come together now. The glossary feels like it’s transitioning from a simple idea to a robust feature that adds real value to the site. I’m learning a lot about balancing technical functionality with user experience, how things look and feel is just as important as what they do. It’s also exciting to think about the connections between different parts of the site and how they can work together seamlessly. With only a couple of weeks left, I’m glad we’re hitting good progress as a team.
