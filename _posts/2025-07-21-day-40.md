what_i_learned: |
  Today, we had an Overleaf tutorial that cleared up a lot of questions about how to use it for our research paper. It was helpful to finally see how everything ties together with citations, formatting, and collaborative writing. It also gave us a better sense of how to start outlining the paper so it won’t feel overwhelming later. After the tutorial, I spent time working on the website, still making small UI tweaks and cleaning up visuals to ensure a clean look. We also started mapping out how to flesh out additional sections of the site, which is key as we only have about a week left.

  None today.

reflection: |
  Learning Overleaf today felt like a productive shift away from just coding. The research paper is equally important as the site itself in showing our process. On the web side, I’m happy with how the site is coming together, even though these little UI adjustments feel endless sometimes. As we move into finishing up the remaining sections, I’m trying to stay organized and pace myself so we’re not scrambling as deadlines get closer. It’s all coming together.
