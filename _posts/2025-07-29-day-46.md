what_i_learned: |
  Today, we officially finalized the last couple of features we’ll be implementing before the final presentation. After trying to fit in as much as we could these past few weeks, we narrowed it down to the News and Music/Dance sections as our last major additions. It’s been tough figuring out what to prioritize, but we realized it’s better to have a strong, working MVP than a scattered, unfinished site. These sections felt the most aligned with our mission and audience, so it made sense to round things off here. I also learned that making those final decisions takes more discipline than adding “just one more thing.”

blockers: |
  The biggest blocker has been wanting to do more than time really allows. We’ve had to scale back some features we were excited about in favor of getting the most impactful ones done well. There are always small UI bugs or adjustments that tempt us to go down rabbit holes, but we're staying focused now. 

reflection: |
  Looking back, it’s wild how much we’ve built and improved in such a short time. Finalizing features today made everything feel more real, like we’re truly approaching the finish line. There's still some polish and cleanup to do, but the core of what we envisioned is there. I'm especially excited about how we’re presenting cultural storytelling through music, dance, and current events. These final sections really tie the project together and give it that human feel.
