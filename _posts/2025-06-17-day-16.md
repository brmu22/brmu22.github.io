what_i_learned: |
   Today, I stayed focused on the website, mainly cleaning up the frontend and fixing smaller tweaks that were left from yesterday. I made a few improvements to the layout and started fixing formatting inconsistencies. Even though I’m still running into issues with displaying PNGs, especially with the flag images, I’ve narrowed down the problem areas and have a better idea of what’s causing it. Troubleshooting taught me how little details in file paths or folder organization can break things visually. It's been a reminder that frontend is just as much about refining as it is about building.

blockers: |
  Ongoing PNG display issues in specific areas of the site. Not too important right now, just annoying.

reflection: |
  Today felt like one of those days where you’re constantly nudging things into place and checking to make sure they look right. It wasn’t a big breakthrough day, but I actually enjoy these smaller wins, like getting spacing or layout elements right. I’m starting to get more confident navigating the site’s structure and solving issues as they come up. Even though the PNG issue is hanging around, it feels more manageable. We’re slowly bringing things together, and I’m proud of the steady progress we’re making.
