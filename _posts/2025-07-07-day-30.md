what_i_learned: |
  My mentor outlined the next steps and set expectations for the week, which helped the team align on priorities. Our primary focus now is on building out the AI so that it can generate summaries for various types of media, including films, shows, and other videos. I’m honestly a little nervous since I’ve never tackled something like this before, but I’m also excited to learn and figure it out along the way. It’s clear we’re shifting into overdrive with the final presentation at the end of the month. The plan now is to divide tasks and make sure every MVP is ready to demo.

  All is well!
  
reflection: |
  Today felt like the calm before the storm. The new AI challenge is definitely outside of my comfort zone, but I think that’s also why I’m looking forward to it. It’s going to push me to problem-solve in new ways and learn more about handling media data. I’m trying not to get too caught up in the pressure and instead focus on taking things step by step. With the whole team locked in, I’m sure we can pull it off.
