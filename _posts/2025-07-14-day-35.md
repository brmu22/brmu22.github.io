what_i_learned: |
  Today, we added a new feature to the site where users can learn about prominent diaspora figures. The AI pulls biographical information and presents a quick overview of their lives and contributions, which was really interesting to set up. It’s a small but impactful addition that helps give more depth to the site. I also started fleshing out the Culture and Arts section, laying out how we want to showcase art, music, and other cultural significance. Having a tentative schedule for the week has really helped keep things on track and reduced some of the stress.

  All is well!
  
reflection: |
   The site’s functionality is feeling pretty solid at this point. So now it’s mostly about updating UI elements like adding images, adjusting layouts, and making sure it feels cohesive. Working on the diaspora figures feature reminded me that it’s not just technical work but a way to tell stories that often get overlooked. I’m excited to see how the Culture and Arts section evolves since it’s a creative part of the diaspora’s history. There’s still a lot to do, but with the schedule in place, I feel more organized and confident about what’s next. Bit by bit, we’re creating something pretty solid.
