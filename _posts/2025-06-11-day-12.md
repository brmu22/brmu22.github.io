what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about research again. I spent most of my time verifying information for over 20 countries in the African diaspora. It was tedious work. I constantly cross-checked facts, updated sources, and ensured everything was accurate. But, I have to admit, it was also enthralling. I got to read about how different communities practice mutual aid and how gender roles and social norms vary from place to place.

  Just a bit of brain fog from all the tabs I had open. ðŸ˜…

reflection: |
  Itâ€™s definitely been a long day of scrolling, reading, and fact-checking, and Iâ€™m starting to feel the mental fatigue setting in. I think whatâ€™s keeping me going is how interesting some of the sources are. Itâ€™s interesting seeing the cultural differences and similarities across the diaspora. Still, Iâ€™m really hoping we can move into the coding or building phase soon. The work is super valuable, but itâ€™s a slow burn. Iâ€™m just trying to pace myself and stay curious through the process.
