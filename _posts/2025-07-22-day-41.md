  Today, we finally started integrating our custom dataset into the AI model. Up until now, we’ve been holding off on using it to save time during presentations and stay focused on the more visible aspects of the site. Seeing the AI pull from data we actually curated feels like a big accomplishment and adds more authenticity to the site’s content. We also began brainstorming for our elevator pitch. We also started writing our final research paper.

  Feeling overwhelmed trying to juggle the research paper, website building, and final site tweaks all at once.

reflection: |
  With the program winding down, I can feel the pressure a bit. There’s a lot to balance to juggle between writing the paper, finishing the site, integrating the AI components, and now an elevator pitch. But despite the stress, I’m proud of how far the project has come and how we’ve managed to pivot when needed. It’s all about pacing and tackling things one step at a time. This week feels like the beginning of the final sprint, and I’m determined to push through.
