what_i_learned: |
  I spent some time today fine-tuning the AI to generate better summaries—just tightening up the prompts and testing how the responses aligned with our intended tone and depth. It’s definitely getting more consistent now, which helps when we’re pulling summaries for different parts of the site. Our group also met with a library team to get feedback on our research process and sources. The goal was to make sure we’re being as objective as possible and not unintentionally introducing bias into the material we present. That conversation helped us think more critically about how we’re framing information, especially since this project centers on real histories and communities.

  An alright day. 💃🏽
  
reflection: |
  The AI updates felt like a step forward, especially since content quality is key for our site. I appreciated getting insight from the librarian who gave us some good tips on source credibility and even helped us brainstorm ways to present material with more transparency. It’s easy to get caught up in building features, but moments like this remind me that our storytelling and research have to be just as solid. We also started practicing for our Thursday presentation, and it’s starting to feel more real. Still a little nervous, but I think we’ll be ready.
