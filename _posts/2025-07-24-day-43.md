what_i_learned: |
  I spent most of today building out the culture section of the website. It’s where we get to highlight not just what our tool does, but why it matters and who it’s for. This required a mindset shift from thinking in terms of tech features to thinking about people and impact. I had to focus on tone, aesthetics, and storytelling to really bring it to life. It reminded me that user appeal is just as important as the AI itself.

blockers: |
  It’s been hard figuring out how much content to include without making the section feel too text-heavy or overwhelming.

reflection: |
  Working on this section made me realize how important it is to anchor our tech in real stories and values. The culture section is less about impressing with features and more about connecting with the people we’re trying to reach. It’s the part of the site where our mission and identity shine through the most. This is what takes it from just being a project to being something with purpose. I’m proud of where it’s going and excited to see how people respond once it's live.
