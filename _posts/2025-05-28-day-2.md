what_i_learned: |
  Today, I revisited Python concepts, specifically on sets and dictionaries. I practiced looping through sets to identify unique items and manipulated a dictionary to store, access, and update data. These exercises helped reinforce how to manage and organize data, skills that will be essential as I prepare for the internship.

  I also had the chance to meet both of my research mentors for the summer. We discussed the goals of the project and how my current skill set aligns with the work we will be doing. It was nice to hear about their vision and get a clearer sense of how I can contribute.

blockers: |
  None today.

reflection: |
  Meeting my mentors today made the whole project feel a lot more real. It was nice to hear more about why they want to take on this project and figure out how I can utilize my skills to contribute. I’m feeling more motivated now that I know who I’ll be learning from. We ended the day with a group game of Heads Up, it was a fun way to end the day on a high note.
