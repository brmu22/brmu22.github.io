what_i_learned: |
  Today's activities were super helpful! We spent our morning practicing how to manipulate a dataset using a sentiment analysis and data visualization demo. I recently created a text-based AI sentiment analysis model for my senior project, so most of the material looked familiar. There were a lot of terms and libraries that I knew the purpose of, but I didn't have a formal definition for them, so it was good to gain some knowledge in that regard.

  After lunch, we were tasked with researching any three countries that would be included on our site. I chose Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. From there, we had to create our custom dataset with 7-8 features. I focused on data such as population size and the percentage of languages that the natives primarily speak. It was very interesting to learn a bit more about these countries during my research. Afterwards, we had to create a visualization aspect to portray the data. 

blockers: |
  While populating my Excel sheet with data, the app crashed, and all the data was lost. I decided to just create a dictionary for the data instead, which would then be saved to a CSV file. So just a minor setback that I was able to handle. :)

reflection: |
  I appreciate the practice we were able to do today, as it helped me gain a better understanding of all of the code I'm writing and the *why* I am using it. It also prepared me for what the upcoming weeks may look like as we progress through the project and how important attention to detail will be.
