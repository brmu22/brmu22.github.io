what_i_learned: |
  Today, we focused entirely on preparing for our final presentation and recording a full demo of the site. It’s been a long road, and this was our chance to put everything together in a clear walkthrough. Recording the demo allowed us to catch a few last-minute UI inconsistencies and gave us a chance to really reflect on how much we've built. I also learned that explaining your work clearly on video is a different skill because it’s about storytelling. We tried to show off both the functionality and the "why" behind the platform.

blockers: |
  The only blocker today was time—we had to squeeze in recording while still coordinating slides and talking points for the presentation. 

reflection: |
  This is the most complete our project has ever felt. Getting to narrate our work made the journey worth it, and I’m proud of how we’ve centered culture and community through design. It’s exciting and a little nerve-wracking to share it with people who weren’t in the trenches building it. Tomorrow we’ll deliver the final presentation, and I think we’re ready. No matter what, we’ve built something impactful.
