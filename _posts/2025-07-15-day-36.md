what_i_learned: |
  Today’s enrichment block was...not the most helpful. We did a bingo activity to “get to know each other” and a personality quiz to supposedly encourage teamwork and help us understand how different people can work together. But at this point in the program, it felt like a waste of valuable time. Most of the team was discouraged and frustrated because activities like this would have been way more useful in the first couple of weeks, not when we’re already used to working together and are racing toward deadlines. Time management is critical, especially since we only have about 2.5 weeks left.
  
blockers: |
  Losing productive time during the enrichment block added extra pressure to stay on track for deadlines.
  
reflection: |
   Even with an odd start to the day, I focused on the site after lunch. I made some small UI tweaks, such as adding images, adjusting spacing, and polishing the overall look to make the site feel more cohesive. The functionality is holding up well, so it’s mostly about refining the visual experience at this stage. I’m trying to stay focused and not let the wasted time derail momentum. We’re too close to the finish line now to get stuck on distractions.
