what_i_learned: |
   I kept working on the frontend today and spent most of my time trying to get the interactive map just right. The marker placements aren’t lining up exactly how I want them yet, but I’m getting closer to figuring it out. I finally pushed the repo to GitHub so everyone on the team can collaborate more easily, which feels like a step forward. We also filmed our Week 4 recap video and talked through our accomplishments and challenges for the week. On top of that, our high school teacher shared some resources we might use for the educators section of the site, which gave us a bit more direction on that feature.

reflection: |
  Even though I hit a few issues with the map, it feels good to have the project live on GitHub and ready for team collaboration. Sharing that space helps keep us in sync and makes it easier to build things together. The weekly recap gave me a chance to reflect on how much we’ve done already. It’s wild how fast time is moving. I’m also really glad to see the teacher stepping in with helpful resources, it shows that he’s engaged and ready to support us. Slowly but surely, the site is coming together, and I’m excited to keep making it better.
